                                        structured by timespace. As a sociologist, I have found the study of everyday
                                        life fascinating. Rather than beginning in an abstract, conceptual world, it has
                                        meant starting in individuals’ own accounts and reflections and in their
                                        understanding of the world in which they live. As a feminist researcher, it has
                                        meant inhabiting the world of women. It has involved taking as my starting point
                                        the ‘real bodies’ of individuals that are enmeshed in timespace.</p>

                                    <p class="paragraph">The concrete reality of women’s daily lives, and the importance
                                        they place on responsibility or a rationality of caring, has led me to try and
                                        extend our theoretical understanding of timespace from a feminist perspective.
                                        The first part of this chapter will attempt to show why gender needs to be
                                        incorporated into discussions of spacetime and takes as its starting point a
                                        critique of the standard time-geography approach. With an emphasis upon an
                                        atomistic and resource based notion of time, the approach fails to fully account
                                        for a relational construction of time that lies at the heart of (women’s)
                                        everyday life as shaped by a rationality of caring. The temporal and spatial
                                        implications that arise from women taking care of others in both the public and
                                        private spheres results in difficulties in carving a space for a ‘pause’ – the
                                        focus of the second part of the chapter. A major characteristic of present-day
                                        society is argued by postmodern or late modern theorists to be reflexivity. Yet
                                        reflexivity in the late modern age requires time – or a ‘pause’ – for
                                        self-reflection and for women this may well be difficult due to the nature of
                                        women’s work and by the ways in which timespace is gendered.</p>

                                    <h1 class="large">The standard time-geography approach</h1>

                                    <p class="paragraph">The time-geography approach, originally developed in Sweden by
                                        Torsten Hägerstrand, has played a fundamental role in helping us understand
                                        space-time. The basic tenets of time-geography are surprisingly simple but
                                        fundamental to social theory. All individuals’ actions take place in time and
                                        space. Since an individual is indivisible, she/he cannot be in two places at the
                                        same time. Time and space therefore impose basic constraints for freedom of
                                        action and movement. Despite the possibility today of transcending classical
                                        one-dimensional time-space frames with the help of cyberspace and new
                                        technology, the above premises still hold true for most social actors navigating
                                        their daily lives. The time-geography approach has been seminal since it gives
                                        prominence to the significance of both space and time. It allows us to
                                        understand how women’s and men’s daily lives are actually shaped in practice,
                                        while also focusing on the constraints or enabling factors that influence choice
                                        and action. Hägerstrand broke with an earlier geographical tradition by
                                        inserting and emphasizing the importance of a social framework. Time in itself,
                                        he argued, was not sufficient for a wider understanding:</p>

                                    <h1 class="quote">The landscape, as we see it, or the region, which we only get to
                                        know more indirectly, is the zone of action as it appears at a particular
                                        moment. It is not enough to add time to the spatial dimension. Not only the
                                        visible participants, but everything that is present. To a great extent human
                                        actors, their knowledge and intentions, belong here naturally, which not even
                                        natural geographers can ignore any longer.</h1>

                                    <h1 class="small">(Hägerstrand, 1985b: 6)</h1>

                                    <p class="paragraph">While the above quotation suggests the potential of dealing
                                        with individuals’ activities in space and time so that complex interconnections
                                        become visible – and this indeed was Hägerstrand’s vision – the model continues
                                        to build on a somewhat limited and traditional understanding of time and this
                                        subsequently mars its possibility of making sense of the gendered nature of
                                        individuals’ lives in a satisfactory manner. In the time-geography approach,
                                        time is identified as a quantity – in terms of the calendar or clock – against
                                        which events in space are related. Its concept of time is linear, drawn as the
                                        y-axis in its diagrams, which may be divided into mathematically exact units.
                                        While Hägerstrand emphasized that individuals’ actions are limited by their
                                        inborn and learned personal qualities, accessible techniques, resources in the
                                        social environment, other individuals’ choices, as well as by rules and norms
                                        developed within governing institutions and organizations, individuals in
                                        time-geography studies tend to be regarded as social atoms rather than acting
                                        subjects. In summarizing many of the criticisms directed at the time-geography
                                        school, Tora Friberg (1993: 78) writes: ‘Time-geography does not take social
                                        processes into account and has an undeveloped view of contradictions and power.
                                        This means that social transformation remains unexplained. Its view of time is
                                        oversimplified.</p>

                                    <h1 class="large">A relational construction of timespace</h1>

                                    <p class="paragraph">The emphasis on time as a resource – equally available to all –
                                        is also inherent in the time-geography model. This understanding of time emerged
                                        in part with the modernist project which emphasized the individual and his/her
                                        identity as well as his/her individual life trajectory. The assumption that time
                                        is an equally distributed resource where each individual receives his/her
                                        allotted share is however, as Ewa Gunnarsson and Ulla Ressner (1985: 109–10)
                                        argue, somewhat problematic:</p>

                                    <h1 class="quote">Even in working life we start from the premise of individual time.
                                        But if we take a look at how women use their time, it’s obvious that it is
                                        rather a question of ‘collective’ time which others, for example, their families
                                        have a right to lay a claim to.</h1>

                                    <h1 class="small">(my translation)</h1>

                                    <p class="paragraph">In other words, how we in fact use our time and locate
                                        ourselves spatially (the two being inseparably related to each other) is
                                        dependent upon the social relations in which we are embedded.</p>

                                    <p class="paragraph">The spatial relations between home and work as well as the
                                        temporal demands in women’s lives have been the subject of a wealth of studies
                                        in recent years. These studies illustrate the ways in which differential access
                                        to space and time are inextricably gendered; that control over time and space,
                                        or at least the ability to be able to freely choose how to use one’s time and
                                        space, are for women substantially influenced by the interlocking of the public
                                        and private spheres and by women’s structural position in these spheres. Who
                                        takes the car to work, how often the buses run, how far away the workplace is,
                                        who drops the children off at day-care, who does the shopping and when the shops
                                        are open, are mundane, everyday considerations where time and space are pivotal
                                        and where gender leaves its imprint in a tangible fashion. </p>

                                    <p class="paragraph">Hanson and Pratt (1995), for example, show how show how women’s
                                        shorter commuting distances may lead to the creation of a number of separate
                                        labour markets within a single metropolitan area as well as how women may become
                                        ‘trapped’ in place as their domestic responsibilities curtail the time available
                                        for commuting to work. Others have shown that the need to work close to home may
                                        mean that women choose jobs beneath their qualifications (Davies, 1990; Freeman,
                                        1982). Women may decide to take jobs in the public sector as opposed to the
                                        private sector because full-time work in the former entails less hours and times
                                        of starting and finishing work are more estimable (Elchardus and Glorieux,
                                        1994). Spatial and temporal considerations may even influence the choice of
                                        home-working, temporary work or work sharing and of course part-time work.
                                        Cynthia Negrey (1993) found in her study of work sharing that for men this form
                                        of employment could mean increased personal autonomy as well as a feeling of
                                        being on vacation, even the possibility for doing specific household projects
                                        arose – while for women this was rarely the case. Finally, as Aitken and Carroll
                                        (1996) found in their review of several research projects concerning the motives
                                        for teleworking, whilst women often emphasized the wish to combine paid work and
                                        family/home in a more flexible fashion, men tended to emphasize the possibility
                                        of escaping the control of the workplace and avoiding ‘face-to-face-authority’.

                                    <p class="paragraph">One of the more useful concepts to emerge within discussions
                                        about more flexible working practices is the notion of time-sovereignty. For
                                        Garhammer (1995) current changes in the organization of working life raise the
                                        possibility of recovering one’s own time from all foreign-determined orders of
                                        time, though that possibility is by no means equally enjoyed by all (Garhammer,
                                        1995). Thus, whilst time-sovereignty is enjoyed by tele-homeworkers and time
                                        pioneers (the latter being: the self-employed, freelance workers and executives,
                                        all of whom it is argued can plan their work time relatively autonomously) at
                                        the other end of the scale we find ‘work on demand’, where the unpredictability
                                        of working hours is extreme, as well as rigid shift schedules or traditional
                                        weekend work where external determination is at the uppermost.</p>

                                    <p class="paragraph">For Garhammer (1995) one of the most significant problems
                                        facing those who would reorder the world of work, providing for greater
                                        flexibility and greater time-sovereignty, is the continuing separation of the
                                        world of paid work from the world of the family. Yet time-sovereignty cannot
                                        only be discussed in relation to the demands of paid work. From a feminist
                                        perspective, work does not only refer to paid labour carried out in the public
                                        (or private) sphere but to unpaid work carried out in the home, informal work
                                        carried out in the community, as well as to what feminists have called emotional
                                        work – which is carried out more or less everywhere and in all contexts (see,
                                        for example, Davies, 1990, 1996a; Hochschild, 1983; James, 1989; di Leonardo,
                                        1987; Leira, 1983; Lynch, 1989; Oakley, 1974).</p>

                                    <p class="paragraph">It follows then that women’s use of time and their temporal
                                        consciousness are strongly related to the time demands of significant others and
                                        this has, of course, important implications for women’s possibility to control
                                        their own time. In a study looking at flexible working hours on an intensive
                                        care unit, for example, nurses who were single were extremely positive about a
                                        newly implemented model within which one could not always be sure when one would
                                        be working, whilst those who had responsibility for others (children, partners,
                                        sick parents) were more apprehensive (Davies, forthcoming).</p>

                                    <p class="paragraph">Nor is it the only time that is of issue here. As with their
                                        use of time, women’s control over space is similarly molded by their
                                        responsibility and caring for others – both on the job and at home – and by
                                        their structural position more generally. Both time and space are, in other
                                        words, not abstract concepts in women’s lives. Rather they are importantly
                                        shaped by the presence and needs/demands of another, be it a child, a sick
                                        parent, a patient, a boss, etc. Space and time are thereby not individual
                                        resources as such, rather they must be understood in a relational manner. Put in
                                        simple terms, where women find themselves and when they find themselves where
                                        they are, are importantly determined by the needs of others.</p>

                                    <p class="paragraph">An individual notion of time thus builds upon a particular
                                        temporal discourse where time is seen as linear, finite and quantitative and
                                        consisting of discrete units which can be divided between work, leisure and
                                        personal time. A number of researchers, including myself, have tried to show
                                        that a linear conception of time is grounded in gendered power relations and in
                                        a discourse of masculinity (Davies, 1990; Forman and Sowton, 1989; Knights and
                                        Odih, 1995; Kristeva, 1981; Nowotny, 1982). Indeed, earlier I have argued
                                        (Davies, 1990) that time that-we-take-for-granted – the present-day dominant
                                        linear and quantitative temporal consciousness – grew out of various religious,
                                        scientific and economic interests, all of which were male dominated. Or put
                                        another way, the social construction of current dominant temporal patterns has
                                        its roots in the central concerns of various male-dominated hierarchies which
                                        were interested in solidifying and retaining their positions of power in
                                        society. By arguing that time cannot only be seen in individual terms, following
                                        the linear yardstick, feminists have shown that women’s time features
                                        simultaneous activities and overlapping temporalities (Adam, 1995; Davies, 1990,
                                        1994, 1996b; Forman and Sowton, 1989; Leccardi and Rampazi, 1993; Leccardi,
                                        1996). It is characterized by plurality and interdependence. Women weave
                                        complicated temporal tapestries consisting of, as Carmen Leccardi and Marita
                                        Rampazi (1993) point out, temporal threads that are biological, social and
                                        chronological, processual, cyclical and linear:</p>

                                    <h1 class="quote">It is a time ‘contaminated’ by cosmic dimensions, linked to the
                                        rhythms of nature, synchronized with the times of economic activity and its
                                        rationality and also with the logic of caring.</h1>

                                    <p class="paragraph">When looking at everyday life, we therefore need to analyse
                                        more carefully how we negotiate and switch between different temporal orders,
                                        how we weave together different temporal patterns, how temporal meaning is
                                        constituted through social interaction and how gender as well as discourses of
                                        femininity and masculinity are part and parcel of all this. Returning to
                                        time-geography, it becomes obvious that the approach has difficulties in
                                        capturing the multidimensionality of women’s time since it builds upon a
                                        discrete temporal framework: one that functions independently of what it
                                        actually means to live, as Friberg (1993) puts it. It is also questionable
                                        whether it captures the reality of men’s lives. To expand upon these arguments
                                        and, more specifically, to illustrate this gendering of timespace, I turn now to
                                        the concept of care and the rationality of caring.</p>

                                    <h1 class="quote">The nurse also sometimes fires furnaces and mends the plumbing,
                                        i.e. she does tasks of people below her or outside the role hierarchy of
                                        medicine. It hurts her, but she does it. Her place in the division of labor is
                                        able to do whatever necessary things are in danger of not being done at all. The
                                        nurse would not like this definition, but she ordinarily in practice rises to
                                        it.</h1>

                                    <h1 class="small">(Hughes, 1984: 308)</h1>

                                    <p class="paragraph">While much has changed in the nursing profession since Everett
                                        Hughes’ account of the profession was written in the 1950s, he nonetheless
                                        captures what is still the essence of servicing work – be it as a nurse, in
                                        other care professions or in the home. Women’s work is importantly premised on
                                        the well-being of others. While Hughes’ words were written long before the
                                        emergence of latter-day feminist writing, the passage therefore links to a
                                        central area of thought and research that was to arise within feminist research,
                                        namely the issue of caring.</p>

                                    <p class="paragraph">Women’s thinking and actions are often fired by a rationality
                                        of caring or responsibility as it has been called in the Scandinavian countries
                                        (see, for example, Sørensen, 1982, Wærness, 1984) or an ethic of care as it has
                                        been named in Anglo-Saxon countries (see, for example, Gilligan, 1982; Tong,
                                        1993). A concrete example of this type of rationality is illustrated in the
                                        following words of a nurse: </p>

                                    <h1 class="quote">If I sit on the edge of a bed and see that the patient is
                                        depressed, well then I’ve got to spend time with him and talk to him. Perhaps
                                        I’ll sit there for half an hour after my hours are over. But it wouldn’t enter
                                        my head to claim overtime. It isn’t a work duty.</h1>

                                    <h1 class="small">(Liljeström and Jarup, 1983: 80; my translation)</h1>

                                    <p class="paragraph">Liljeström and Jarup argued that in many women’s jobs, the
                                        similarity between what women do for free and what they do for a wage makes it
                                        difficult for them to distinguish between what belongs to their private life and
                                        what belongs to the job. Regardless of whether the actions of the nurse as
                                        described above make sense or not from a labor union or economic rational point
                                        of view (and certainly such actions reinforce women’s under-paid and lowly
                                        valued positions in the labor market) they are understandable in terms of a
                                        rationality of caring. This is an ideological issue: for women there exists the
                                        moral imperative to care for those who cannot care for themselves (cf. Cunnison,
                                        1986).</p>

                                    <p class="paragraph">While a rationality of care has been highly fruitful in
                                        examining care occupations and in understanding many of the invisible components
                                        in these types of jobs, it has also been useful when appraising all sorts of
                                        service jobs – where men too may be found in large numbers, such as janitor,
                                        taxi driver, or community police officer – as well as in women’s experiences of
                                        (male dominated) skilled industrial work (Gunnarsson, 1994; Motevasel, 1996). A
                                        rationality of caring means that one is very much <i>‘other oriented’</i>. It
                                        involves being sensitive and showing empathy and being able to put one’s self in
                                        the other’s shoes. It means being able to meet the other’s needs in a
                                        spatial-temporal here-and-now. Thought and action grow out of social praxis.
                                        This ‘other orientation’ and women’s understanding of its importance, means that
                                        women will often waive rules and routines which are grounded in linear and
                                        commodified time. A municipal home help, for example, receives instructions from
                                        her superiors about which jobs she may and may not do for the care-receiver and
                                        how much time she may spend on these activities. But the home-help’s
                                        understanding of the actual needs of the pensioner means that these instructions
                                        are often put aside. She designs her own schedule. For example, cleaning the
                                        windows may be one of the duties that the home-help may not carry out. However,
                                        the pensioner’s birthday is coming up and relatives and friends will be visiting
                                        for a small celebration. For the pensioner in question, it is immensely
                                        important that the windows are polished. The home help understands the
                                        importance and is prepared to carry out the duty. This complex relationship to
                                        time is closely related to specific types of knowledge, i.e. ‘knowing in action’
                                        and ‘reflection in action’, to use Donald Schön’s (1983) concepts. It means that
                                        women display a flexible relationship to their work and to relationships within
                                        that work. It allows a woman to know how she should best act in a certain
                                        situation, based upon her own judgment and her understanding of the needs of the
                                        other – rather than upon a bureaucratic and economic rationality. Here I am
                                        drawn to the concept of a rationality of caring as it links rationality with
                                        feelings – a connection central to a feminist epistemology, as others have
                                        noted:</p>

                                        postmodern feminists has taught us to be wary of universal accounts and of
                                        side-stepping difference. Yet, whilst the forms a rationality of caring takes
                                        obviously vary according to context and position, it appears to be an important
                                        component in most women’s lives regardless of whether they are middle class or
                                        working class (see Davies, 1990; Friberg, 1993; Franssén, 1997). As Beverley

                                        through the women’s exercise of responsibility which was opposite to the
                                        traditional form of individual responsibility outlined by Mauss (1985) in his
                                        discussion of the development of the concept of the self. Rather than being the

                                        (and on which modernist theories of justice and morality are built), their
                                        selves were full of duty and obligation generated through their relationships to

                                    <p class="paragraph">IN THE SECOND part of this chapter I will be illustrating some
                                        of the features of women’s timespace with the help of empirical material from
                                        studies that I have carried out in Sweden. The examples are taken almost
                                        exclusively from the practices of women working in the care professions where
                                        the rationality of caring comes to the fore and where the problem of finding
                                        time for a ‘pause’ are highlighted. But the patterns that emerge are more
                                        general, illustrative of the patterns of women’s lives more broadly and set by
                                        the wider gendering of the public and private spheres.</p>

                                    <h1 class="large">Pauses</h1>

                                    <p class="paragraph">Pauses are moments at work or at home when the usual flow of
                                        work is halted for a period. Snow and Brisset (1986: 12) delineate the
                                        importance of pauses: </p>

                                    <h1 class="quote">The most far-reaching consequence of pauses is that they are
                                        essential in establishing a rhythm in one’s personal and social existence. The
                                        fact that rhythm is ubiquitous in all life forms may belie its importance. At
                                        the very least we feel that pausing provides the contrast, emphasis, and energy
                                        that aid in developing and sustaining meaning in any arena.</h1>

                                    <h1 class="small">Snow and Brisset (1986: 12)</h1>

                                    <p class="paragraph">Thus, Snow and Brisset (1986) emphasize that pauses should not
                                        simply be conceptualized as breaks in action or periods of inactivity. Rather,
                                        pauses are important for ‘recharging the batteries’, for rest and relaxation.
                                        They also fill another important function, namely the space they provide for
                                        reflection – a process essential for the development of one’s professional self
                                        as well as for selfgrowth more generally. I will attempt to show that while
                                        pauses are essential for an individual’s wellbeing, they may in fact be
                                        difficult for women to achieve because of the nature of women’s work where
                                        caring for others is often central. Having illustrated the difficulties women
                                        find in carving a space for a pause, the chapter ends by considering the
                                        implications of such difficulties for those who would propose a ‘reflexive turn’
                                        to the (post)modern subject. Specifically, the remainder of the chapter
                                        juxtaposes the reality of the lives of the women interviewed below with the
                                        allegorical constructions of Giddens (1991) and Bauman (1995) and their
                                        (essentialist) discussion of the reflexivity of the postmodern self.</p>

                                    <h1 class="large">There’s never a spare moment</h1>

                                    <p class="paragraph">‘There’s never a spare moment’ succinctly summarizes the
                                        reality of care-work and of process time (see Davies, 1994, 1996a).</p>

                                    <p class="paragraph">Tasks are not easily divided off from each other and the nature
                                        of care-work presupposes that as a carer you are always available. Timespace is
                                        not neatly packaged, so to say, nor easily negotiable. </p>

                                    <p class="paragraph">In child day-care, staff find that they are always being
                                        interrupted, both when involved with the children and when talking to other
                                        staff. The nature of the work allows no time for reflection or ‘time for
                                        digestion’, as one person put it.</p>

                                    <h1 class="quote">The few occasions when we get a chance to talk to each other, it’s
                                        in passing … but you never get a chance to finish a conversation. You never get
                                        a chance to finish a thought.</h1>

                                    <h1 class="small">(my translation)</h1>

                                    <p class="paragraph">At one of the child day-care centers I studied, each unit
                                        washed up after every meal. This entailed taking the dirty crockery and cutlery
                                        into the kitchen, loading the dish-washer, waiting for the machine to be done,
                                        drying certain items by hand, taking everything back to the unit and putting it
                                        away in a cupboard. By definition, washing-up is a fairly repetitive and boring
                                        activity. It also struck me that this was an additional task that the staff were
                                        forced to do and that this was possibly disadvantageous in terms of ‘snatching’
                                        time from being with the children. Yet with time, I saw that it was a duty that
                                        also provided an unexpected gift – in that it provided time for reflection,
                                        allowing the member of staff both space and time to slip away momentarily from
                                        the never-ceasing demands and care of the children.</p>

                                    <p class="paragraph">Thought takes time, and space for this work – both in terms of
                                        a separate time period and a separate place – is often limited in women’s jobs.
                                        Time allotted for meetings in day-care centers, for example, is minimal with
                                        just two hours a month set aside for staff conferences and a quarter of an hour
                                        a week for parents. While thinking obviously takes place on these occasions,
                                        there is for the most part ‘a voluminous agenda’ as one interviewee put it and
                                        much of the discussion is devoted to the fixing of practical things. In other
                                        words, talk – in a more open and creative sense – is usually strictly
                                        circumscribed.

                                        In daily care-work there is no space devoted purely to thinking as a particular
                                        and separate activity. Not surprisingly, women will often therefore explain how
                                        they use traveling time to plan their work. As one of the principals of a
                                        day-care center put it, for example:</p>

                                    <h1 class="quote">I start organizing in my mind on the bus in the mornings.</h1>

                                    <p class="paragraph">Or as another said:</p>

                                    <h1 class="quote">You often plan while you cycle to the nursery.</h1>

                                    <p class="paragraph">The quotation below explains more clearly why time for
                                        reflection/discussion is difficult to incorporate into care-work. Whilst the
                                        quotation is specifically about the principal’s work, the underlying tension and
                                        problem are relevant for all care workers in day nurseries and other caring
                                        professions:</p>

                                        say to yourself, ‘When I get back to work, I’m going to sit down, reflect – give
                                        these things some real thought.’ For example, how can we best work with our
                                        budget and how can we put our goals into practice, economically. And I think to

                                        solve this?’ I’ll take over the kitchen on Monday and Tuesday, and then someone

                                        function clearly to ourselves – because when I get here, it’s the actual
                                        day-to-day running of the day-care which comes first. I have to solve these
                                        questions first if there’s going to be any day-care at all and the rest has to
                                        be put on the shelf in the meantime. There’s no way you can say that the food
                                        can wait until next week because I want to go into my office and think for a

                                        when there’s time, and then it feels more like a burden in some way – ‘ugh, I’ve
                                        got this to think about as well’ and maybe several months have passed since it
                                        was a salient issue.</h1>

                                    <h1 class="small">(nursery/pre-school principal; my translation)</h1>

                                    <p class="paragraph">The quotation highlights the issue that lies at the very heart
                                        of things. Care and caring have to be given regardless and cannot be temporally
                                        or spatially confined. Care-work can be planned, but we cannot expect our plans
                                        to hold. Activities cannot be neatly scheduled; the unexpected repeatedly rears
                                        its head and demands flexibility and a process relation to time. Time for
                                        reflection for oneself – and with others – by necessity gets put aside.
                                        Spatially it is difficult to leave those who cannot care for themselves and
                                        concentrate on one’s own thought and discussion. And if there is no time for
                                        reflection, it is not surprising that women’s jobs often tend to display a
                                        certain conservatism. </p>

                                    <p class="paragraph">A similar pattern can be found within hospital work where it
                                        proves impossible either to set specific time (and space) aside for discussion
                                        and reflection or to respond to the need for such discussion as and when the
                                        situation demands as the relation to the patient (and his/her relatives) is
                                        always given priority. Yet pauses are essential, and not least for an airing of
                                        ethical issues. Bischofberger et al. (1991) argue that medical ethics have a
                                        tendency to concentrate their focus on the beginning and end of life. But,
                                        everything that lies between may be equally important. According to Björkqvist
                                        and Åhlman (1996), nurses should be trained to reflect over ethical problems
                                        even on relatively undramatic and everyday occasions, in order to learn from
                                        shared experience and in order to change their everyday way of working. Everyday
                                        situations could, for example, entail opinions about forced feeding of senile
                                        patients, withholding information to patients, or reactions to a battered woman
                                        who seeks treatment to name but a few. </p>

                                    <p class="paragraph">Pauses for the discussion of ethical issues and the philosophy
                                        of care more generally should obviously be incorporated into the daily routine.
                                        Yet their implementation seems difficult. In part this can be related to a
                                        tradition of medical care built around a strictly gendered hierarchy where it
                                        was expected that nurses carry out the doctors’ orders and not think too much
                                        for themselves.But it may also be related to the difficulty the care worker
                                        faces in leaving those who cannot care for themselves and creating the time or
                                        space for reflection. The situation is exacerbated by present-day cut-backs and
                                        rationalizations and by a trend prevalent in all walks of working life where
                                        individuals are responsible for a greater array of tasks, increasing the general
                                        work-load and eliciting feelings of being split. The letter that was previously
                                        typed and posted by the secretary is now the responsibility of each individual
                                        with the aid of their personal computer. The demands for documentation, quality
                                        assurance, etc. increase the requirements placed, for example, upon the nurse.
                                        Time becomes increasingly scarce.</p>

                                        others affects these women’s access to the time and space necessary for
                                        reflection, the differential ability to access such timespace cannot be
                                        considered outside of the unequal relations of power that structure the
                                        workplace and which, in nursing as in a range of other fields, are powerfully
                                        gendered. Thus, there are literally no spaces where nurses may ‘hide’, their
                                        offices are usually characterized by glass windows. Refusing to be continually
                                        available is, it might be argued, a strategy of resistance as well as an
                                        indication of processes of professionalisa- tion in women’s jobs and in Sweden
                                        doctors have been heard complaining that nurses are just not in their offices
                                        any more – and thereby available – as they used to be (Närvänen, 1994).</p>

                                        problematics I have recounted can therefore be recognised in other areas too.
                                        For example, and not surprisingly perhaps, secretaries and others in servicing
                                        positions also often feel the demands of being constantly available, of having
                                        to keep tabs on everything, and of how their time and space are regulated by
                                        others as access to one’s own time and space becomes an ever more critical
                                        problem in the modern workplace, structured by an (often gendered) hierarchy of
                                        power.</p>

                                    <h1 class="large">Time Out</h1>

                                    <p class="paragraph">Whilst I have so far concentrated solely upon a discussion of
                                        working life, the problems encountered by women in taking what might be called
                                        ‘time out’ (time away not just from others but time when one does not have to
                                        take the needs of others into account) are clearly evident in other arenas too
                                        (see Davies, 1990). For women, there are few ‘holes’ in the intricate temporal
                                        structures of everyday life. And when time out does occur, it will probably take
                                        place spatially close to those one is responsible for. Given such difficulties
                                        it is perhaps not surprising that needlework, embroidery and knitting have
                                        traditionally been the mainstay of women’s leisure activities – not time out in
                                        the true sense, but rather as Verdier (1981) remarks with regard to embroidery
                                        ‘an art of waiting’.</p>

                                    <p class="paragraph">In contrast, men’s time out (such as frequenting football
                                        matches or the local pub) tends to take place away from the home or from those
                                        one has a caring responsibility for. Men’s own time (in the form of sporting
                                        activities or social drinking, for example) may also be a way of constructing
                                        masculinity and of facilitating homosociability, which in turn can ensure a
                                        collective control of particular resources as David Morgan (1981: 104) has
                                        recognised:</p>

                                    <p class="paragraph">Whilst, with the emergence of extensive women’s networking, it
                                        might be argued that this situation is changing (and Morgan’s account is taken
                                        from the early 1980s) it is difficult not to compare men’s ‘time out’ with one
                                        of my female interviewees whose access to ‘own time’ was powerfully prescribed
                                        by her feelings of a duty of care to her family (Davies, 1990). A housewife, one
                                        of her chief interests was making pottery, which she displayed at exhibitions.
                                        To make time for her pottery, the respondent had to get up early in the morning
                                        way ahead of the rest of the family as once they awoke ‘her time’ as she put it
                                        had to give way to ‘their time’. If she did pottery during the daytime, she
                                        reported feelings of guilt (and even though the potter’s wheel was itself, and
                                        not coincidentally perhaps, strategically placed beside the washing machine).
                                        The relational context of women’s time affects their ability to enjoy longer
                                        periods of ‘time out’ too. Rosemary Deem (1996) for example, has shown that with
                                        the preparation beforehand (for example, packing, buying aspirins and suntan
                                        oil, preparing the house for a prolonged absence, canceling of milk and
                                        newspapers, etc.) and the work afterwards (unpacking and washing) having a
                                        holiday can also be extremely stressful for women and not least as their time
                                        ‘away’ is itself liable to be spent adjusting their activities to the needs and
                                        wants of children and husbands.</p>

                                        all human activity. Modern reflexivity involves a constant revision of and
                                        rethinking over actions and decisions in the light of new information or
                                        knowledge. Even whilst the aim is to influence one’s future, a prerequisite for
                                        such reflection is therefore time within the present in which one might
                                        undertake the task of reflection. If self reflection is thus linked to
                                        self-actualisation, as Giddens (1991: 77) stresses both are dependent upon the

                                    <p class="paragraph">But, as became evident in the accounts above, it is very
                                        difficult for women to find these zones of time only remotely connected to
                                        external temporal orders as the needs of others constantly circumscribe their
                                        access to their own time and space. Likewise, for those in the position of carer
                                        it is perhaps difficult to trace that other feature of late-modern life so
                                        famously celebrated by Giddens, notably the ‘pure relationship’ – central to
                                        which is a commitment to others built upon reciprocity, rather than dependency.
                                        Denied the reflexivity essential to self actualisation, the relationships of
                                        dependency that characterize the care relationship may also deny the possibility
                                        of the more equal relationships that would in turn help create that space.</p>

                                    <h1 class="large">The player + the responsibility?</h1>

                                    <p class="paragraph">To end I would like to suggest some other ways in which the
                                        realities of women’s day-to-day lives may complicate readings of a new project
                                        of the self (set within a new framework of space and time) argued by some
                                        (mainly male) theorists to characterize the shift from the modern to a
                                        postmodern world. For Zygmunt Bauman (1995), the essential character of modern
                                        and postmodern life is intimately connected to our understandings of time and
                                        space. Modern life is seen as a pilgrimage. Whilst Truth is elsewhere (some
                                        distance and some time away) one knows where one is heading, the destination is
                                        fixed and the unbending arrow of time supports the pilgrim on his journey. His
                                        identity is staked out: </p>

                                    <h1 class="quote">Time one can use to measure distances must be of the sort that
                                        that schoolboy rulers are – straight, in one piece, with equidistant markings,
                                        made of tough and solid material. And such was, indeed, the time of modern
                                        living-towards-projects. It was like life itself – directional, continuous, and
                                        unbendable. Time that ‘marches on’ and ‘passes’. Both life and time were made to
                                        the measure of pilgrimage. </h1>

                                    <h1 class="small">(Bauman, 1995: 87) </h1>

                                    <p class="paragraph">In a note Bauman points out that the pilgrim is spoken of as
                                        masculine. Selfcreation, an important component of the pilgrim’s project, was
                                        not open to women. ‘[Women] were consigned to the background, to the landscape
                                        through which the itinerary of the pilgrim is plotted, were cast in perpetual
                                        “here and now”; in a space without distance and time without future’ (Bauman,
                                        1995: 87). By contrast, identity building is cast differently under
                                        postmodernity. The task now, for Bauman at least, is to avoid being fixed. Here
                                        time is fleeting, there is no specific goal. Time is only now, fragmented into
                                        episodes and space could be anywhere: </p>

                                    <h1 class="quote">Time is no more a river, but a collection of ponds and pools.</h1>

                                    <h1 class="small">(Bauman, 1995: 91)</h1>

                                    <p class="paragraph">To capture this new sense of time and space, Bauman replaces
                                        the modern figure of the pilgrim with four different, though overlapping, roles:
                                        that of the stroller, the vagabond, the tourist and the player – roles that, and
                                        significantly, may now be taken by women as often as by men.</p>

                                    <p class="paragraph">Yet it is perhaps at least questionable whether women should be
                                        included at all in the (post)modern world thus described. Each of Bauman’s
                                        figures is, after all, based upon a notion of individuality where responsibility
                                        for others does not exist. How can one be a vagabond and look after children or
                                        a frail mother? Likewise, whilst strolling aimlessly around the mall hardly
                                        makes sense for the harried mother and employee who whisks round the supermarket
                                        before picking up her children from day-care the world of the player described
                                        by Bauman – a world where there are ‘just the moves – more or less clever,
                                        shrewd or tricky, insightful or misguided’ – bears little resemblance to the
                                        world of the carer (Bauman, 1995: 98).</p>

                                    <p class="paragraph">Bauman is concerned, of course, with the articulation of a new
                                        ethics, a readmission of the other as neighbor; re-creating a ‘being for’ in
                                        place of the ‘being with’ or ‘being aside’ that is characteristic of the
                                        relationships of the stroller, vagabond, tourist or player. Yet if ‘being for’
                                        means a true meeting of selves where distance is shattered and time (for others)
                                        extended, in place of these grand narratives of epochal change Bauman and others
                                        who search for that new ethics may do better to re-examine the everyday
                                        practices of modern life. It is precisely a ‘being for’ that characterizes the
                                        world of the carer and women everywhere who live (for better or worse) with the
                                        rationality of care. Far from framed by a new sense of time and space, the
                                        spatio-temporal parameters of the carer’s world are familiar ones, carrying with
                                        them both opportunities and constraints.</p>
